        <p class='project-description'>This Collector App project improved my understanding of the HTTP request-response
        protocol between client/server and the POST/GET request methods. I added client-side and server-side form
        validation, understanding why this is necessary. I learnt how to incorporate PHP in a HTML file, making use of
        PHP shorthand syntax. Building the containers helped me to improve my knowledge of CSS flexbox and I added
        breakpoints/relative units to make the site responsive. I wrote SQL queries to add, extract, and order data.</p>

        <p class='project-description'>The first team project of the bootcamp involved working alongside 5 other
        students to build a game using JavaScript. At the start of week, I met with the team to discuss, score, and
        assign stories. I took part in daily Stand-Ups and a Sprint Review/Retrospective at the end of the week. I
        gained experience carrying out peer reviews, making pull requests, and using Git to create branches/handle merge
        conflicts.</p>
        <p class='project-description'>My assigned stories included game design, building the initial screen with
        instructions modal, displaying the next quote, timer, and leaderboard. Creating the modals enabled me to become
        more familiar with the CSS box model and how to use JavaScript with CSS. I used asynchronous operations to
        fetch the film data in JSON format and send data to an API for the leaderboard. My biggest challenge during the
        project came when click events were being duplicated, causing the quiz to skip quotes and end within a few
        seconds. Solving this problem helped me to see the benefit of using Chrome DevTools for debugging.</p>

        <p class='project-description'>This Job Listing website was once again completed in a team of 6. My assigned
        stories were to display the recent jobs and to allow users to browse/filter skills. I enjoyed using Bootstrap
        for this project and learnt how to use components, props, and hooks in React. I learnt the importance of
        designing the architecture prior to build, especially with the hooks needing to follow a tree like structure. It
        was also beneficial to see how smaller files and a structured file system aid readability.

        included architecture/database design, displaying products, and handling currency
        conversion. I created different types of classes including abstract, interface, hydrator, and service. I also
        became more familiar with error handling and providing responses. Overall, I enjoyed writing object-oriented
        code and would like more practise with it.</p>

        <p class='project-description'>The AcademyPortal project is an in-house business management app used by the
        course provider, that includes contributions from past cohorts. Working in a team of 6, I was tasked with
        building new features using the Slim PHP framework MVC pattern, including giving users the capability to edit
        and delete trainers. I was also tasked with fixing bugs, such as resolving why a status message was appearing on
        the wrong page. This was my first time working with a large codebase, and it was a good challenge trying to
        understand existing code, although it was made more difficult due to much of the code being written using
        jQuery.</p>
        <p class='project-description'>I volunteered to be Scrum Master for this project, supporting team members across
        the week, leading Stand-Ups and end of day meetings, and completing a burndown chart at the end of each day. All
        stories accepted on the Monday were completed by Wednesday and I received a lot of positive feedback from my
        cohort and trainer. I focused on respecting the motivations of individuals with the stories they accepted,
        providing regular updates on our progress, giving team members a platform to explain their solutions to enhance
        learning, encouraging team members to address any weaknesses by going out of their comfort zone, and ensuring
        the Trello board was kept organised, with all stories adhering to our agreed Definition of Done.</p>

        <p class='project-description'>In the final project of the bootcamp, I worked in a team of 3 to build the
        frontend and backend of a London Underground Journey Planner app. I was initially involved in planning the app
        and database architecture. On the frontend, I added the drop-down lists of stations, ensuring once a station had
        been selected from the first drop-down, it was absent from the second. On the backend, I wrote the functionality
        to display journey costs and assisted a team member in getting the journeys.</p>
        <p class='project-description'>This was a very challenging project, and we were unable to complete the
        story in which users could view how to reach their destination via multiple changes. I was informed during the
        Sprint Review that this would have involved using Dijkstra's algorithm. This project certainly gave me an
        appreciation for the amount of work that's involved in full stack development and the importance of working in
        unison.</p>
