    <section class='about-me'>
        <p>I have spent most of my working life working in data teams in roles at UCAS, an online university in
        Australia, the Ministry of Education in New Zealand, and managing a team for a marketing company in Scotland. It
        was my experience working as part of an agile project team in New Zealand, tasked with creating a new school
        infrastructure database, that got me interested in software development. In my roles of Regression Tester and
        Data Quality Analyst, I was able to work with some great people and understand the complexities of creating and
        launching a software product. It was a lot of fun seeing the product evolve in Sprint Reviews, having Morning
        Tea get-togethers every Friday with the team, and having the opportunity to train staff in regional offices
        across New Zealand during the migration phase.</p>
        <p>After a lot of reflection during the pandemic, I decided to make a career change and return to university. I
        had studied at university before, although had never achieved a Bachelor's degree. I considered taking a
        Computer Science or Digital Media program, although opted to take an innovative entrepreneurship program that
        was adopted from Finland just over a decade ago. This program was called <a href='https://te.uwe.ac.uk/'
        target='_blank'>Business (Team Entrepreneurship)</a> and involved working in a team of 10-15 people, with the
        aim of achieving annual business targets through executing an effective strategy. I had some ideas of products I
        wanted to build and this program gave me the freedom to do this, whilst also testing their value with customers.
        </p>
        <p>In my 1st year on the program, I created a discount website aimed at helping students save money at local
        food and beverage businesses. I was able to attract business customers who saw students as a good market to help
        them bring in more revenue during quiet periods. At the end of the year, I decided to build a customer loyalty
        mobile app. I started learning to write code, opting to use Flutter SDK and Dart to make it simpler to develop
        for cross-platform and Firebase for the database. Over the next 2yrs I failed miserably, completely
        underestimating the complexities of teaching myself software development.</p>
        <p>However, through hard work, I was still able to achieve a First Class Honours. I developed a lot of key
        competencies and learnings throughout this program, which make me a valuable team member, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Being able to lead without a title
            <li>Understanding the importance of following processes
            <li>Respecting the motivations of peers and not pulling them in a direction they don't want to go
            <li>Working effectively in a team, including communicating well with difficult individuals, and creating a
            psychologically safe environment for all
            <li>Providing constructive feedback that allows team members to reflect on their performance
            <li>Making effective decisions that will make the business more successful
            <li>Managing my time and priorities well to ensure work is completed ahead of deadline
        </ul>
        <p> Still determined to become competent at programming, after my degree, I enrolled in an in-person <a
        href='https://io-academy.uk/courses/full-stack-track/' target='_blank'>16wk Full Stack bootcamp</a> in Bath from
        July-October 2024. This program helped me to address my weaknesses and enabled me to learn in a structured way,
        initially focusing on HTML/CSS, then building projects with PHP/JavaScript, and next working with libraries and
        frameworks. This program vastly improved my programming competence thanks to the excellent training I received
        and well thought through curriculum. I am now looking forward to joining a company to
        demonstrate the skills I have gained from both of these programs, to improve further, and to help the business
        grow. Below you'll find some of the projects I worked on during the bootcamp.</p>

        <p class='project-description'>This Collector App project improved my understanding of the HTTP request-response
        protocol between client/server and the POST/GET request methods. I added client-side and server-side form
        validation, understanding why this is necessary. I learnt how to incorporate PHP in a HTML file, making use of
        PHP shorthand syntax. Building the containers helped me to improve my knowledge of CSS flexbox and I added
        breakpoints/relative units to make the site responsive. I wrote SQL queries to add, extract, and order data.</p>
